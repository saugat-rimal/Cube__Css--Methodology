# Cube__Css--Methodology

CUBE CSS is a CSS methodology that’s orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and consistency. It’s designed to work with the medium that you’re working in—often the browser—rather than against it.

## What does CUBE CSS stand for?
CUBE stands for Composition Utility Block Exception. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The CSS part comes straight from the language: CSS (opens new window).

The name of this methodology gives the game away straight away; it’s an extension of CSS rather than a reinvention of CSS. The CUBE part extends what we already get for free with CSS to give us a little bit of control, where we need it.

This differs somewhat to other popular methodologies like BEM (opens new window), which are very good in their own right, but also run against the grain of CSS.

## How does CUBE CSS compare to other methodologies?
If you were to compare methodologies: it would be safe to say that CUBE CSS takes most of its inspiration from BEM (opens new window). A good way to think of it is a step back from BEM’s principles.

This is because the core of BEM is blocks, whereas with CUBE CSS, the core is CSS. The cascade and inheritance are embraced, not avoided, so by the time you get down to blocks in CUBE, they become much more insignificant.
